BDEsize: An R Package for efficient determination of sample size in a balanced design of experiments

The determination of an appropriate sample size in a balanced design of experiments
is crucial for the statistical inference. The R package BDEsize  computes the optimal
sample size to detect a certain standardized effect size acquiring certain power at a
significance level. Diagnostic graphs produced by the R package BDEsize  provide
the information of the mutual relationships between the sample size, the power, and
the detectable standardized effect size. By investigating those graphs, we can identify
some effects sensitive to the sample size, and adjust the sample size for achieving the
purpose of experiment.
